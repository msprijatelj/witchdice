### TODO


- better responsive design for damage edit
  - make damage source/tags look more optional

- validation for damage number inputs
- collapsible dice bag/party menu (or rearrange the whole thing again)
- add modifiers to dicebag rolls
- make the background a sketch pad

- give dicebag sum/low/high options to know what to do with all the rolls
  -- have it pull through to party rolls

- paralyzation//assassin; all attacks are crits
- vulnerability, resistance, immunity

- Firbase-side validate room/person name; must be length X & are only letters
  Auth system: conference-room rules.
  If you're the first to show up to a room, it's yours.
  If there is anyone in it already, they need to give you the thumbs-up.
    (waiting & cancel button on newcomer, confirm & requester name on all occupants)
  All rooms are cleared out twelve hours after the last message is sent on them.
  Be able to go straight to the room by visiting the room url

- put together a how-to imgur album with gifs
- import spells
- import the monster manual
  (add legendary actions)
  (add special_abilities e.g. sneak attack 1/turn)
  (die-less damage rolls don't work; see crab)
- monster search: don't show any until search filter applied. Add to front of recent list if searching, otherwise perserve recent list order. Clear filter after clicking monster while filtering


- someday: switch away from the heavy firebase server to a lightweight peer-to-peer network

- hover over dice bag buttons for a second to show which type of die it is (replace image)
- setting: customize which icon shows up for natural 20s
- sort abilities to end of roll list
- themes e.g. dark mode
