### TODO

- paralyzation; all attacks are crits
- vulnerability, resistance, immunity
- uncanny dodge : be able to halve any roll
  (use as general case for saving throws, resistance)

- bug: blanking out attack description text makes it un-re-editable

- if click on a attack name, it doesn't auto-select the text box when you're editing

- change "first hit" to "once per turn", just apply it on the first hit (or have that be additional)
	- bonus action for fighting makes things harder because there are different modifiers for the attacks
	- anything for two-weapon fighting will make it harder
	- could add sneak attack as a separate thing;; just attaches to the first roll

- setting to customize which icon shows up for natural 20s

### COMMANDS

- npm start
