### TODO

- make better way to delete attacks, less accidental
- re-implement automatic save/hit calculations

- paralyzation; all attacks are crits
- vulnerability, resistance, immunity
- uncanny dodge : be able to halve any roll
  (use as general case for saving throws, resistance)

- bug: blanking out attack description text makes it un-re-editable




### COMMANDS

- npm start
- Stars a server

- npm run build
- Creates a production build
- Then copy all files in that folder to public_html/roll-to-hit
- Then move static and assets to just public_html/
