### TODO

- make better way to delete attacks, less accidental
- re-implement automatic save/hit calculations

- saving throws
- evasion; half damages are converted to none, full damages are halved
- paralyzation; all attacks are crits
- vulnerability, resistance, immunity
- uncanny dodge : be able to halve any roll
  (use as general case for saving throws, resistance)

- bug: blanking out attack description text makes it un-re-editable
