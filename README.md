### TODO

- make better way to delete attacks, less accidental
- re-implement automatic save/hit calculations

- paralyzation; all attacks are crits
- vulnerability, resistance, immunity
- uncanny dodge : be able to halve any roll
  (use as general case for saving throws, resistance)

- bug: blanking out attack description text makes it un-re-editable

roll-to-hit
- if click on a weapon, it doesn't auto-select the text box when you're editing

- change "first hit" to "once per turn", just apply it on the first hit (or have that be additional)
	- bonus action for fighting makes things harder because there are different modifiers for the attacks
	- anything for two-weapon fighting will make it harder
	- could add sneak attack as a separate thing;; just attaches to the first roll

- nat 1s should always miss

- it would be nice to be able to clear dice rolls --- get a clean slate

- want to just be able to roll one of the things -- checkbox next to each attack (right above the roller, not all the way up at the top)

- separate button for deleting attacks

- setting to customize which icon shows up for natural 20s

### COMMANDS
