- add in helpful pointers for how to de-colonialize dnd
  - orcs & goblins: recommend hobgoblins, it's the season to punch nazis
  - somehow recommend the class-base attribute system
  - drow; all races are evil? how to better handle "evil" societies

  - great breakdown of the history of orcs
  - Orcs punch Nazis.      YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH <3 <3

- https://pocgamer.com/2019/08/02/decolonization-and-integration-in-dd/
  - With the Half and Lineage races, the first step to decolonization and integration is to STOP CALLING THEM HALF-WHATEVER
  - Remember that if players and DMs can tell the difference between villainous humans and non-villainous humans, they can do the same with Orcs and Goblins.

  - The key to making violence in a game unpalatable to fascists is to make it unheroic. In fascist ideology, the dealer of violence is a great man, a hero to be looked up to, someone who cuts through the polite niceties of society to achieve their goals. Violence is seldom this way in real life. Real violence is uncomfortable and difficult and is seldom applauded, and is never applauded by all.

My understanding of the primary problems in DnD:

1. Race mechanics. It is, at its core, old racist bioessentialist pseudoscience. The history is clear.
  - nk jemison says that it's not worth even engaging; any kind of internalization and digestion and output of something better (culturally-distinct empathetic orcs who punch nazis) is worse than telling your own stories from scratch. It's the Kamigawa problem; why would you handicap yourself from the outset instead of making something new?
  - my answer for WITCH DICE: to come to people where they're at and give them a gateway to someplace better. This isn't everybody's work; *my* job is to become a bridge to those other, better, worlds and stories.
  - hotpatch: background/culture attribute bonuses instead of racial ones, overhaul how half-X races are handled.

2. Violence. Dnd glorifies violence. It reiterates the permissability of violence against the Other. It practices us in dehumanizing others so we may kill them and take their things.
  - hotpatch: flesh out non-combat mechanics. WITCH + CRAFT. Complex skill checks.
  - WITCH DICE: show them other games to play. tools for those games && links to podcasts of such.
