          <h3> <span role='img' aria-label='flower'>🌺</span> Olive's Fun Anti-Racism Corner — Orcs! <span role='img' aria-label='flower'>🌺</span> </h3>
          <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Orcs and goblins, in their current standard-fantasy incarnation, come from J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy. Their design is, somewhat incoveniently, <strong>staggeringly racist.</strong></p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Tolkien describing an entire race of people as primitive and warlike was a fusion of then-fashionable pseudo-biological scientific racism, Yellow Peril, and the idea of <strong>"martial races"</strong>, which he picked up during his military service. British occupiers of India had gotten into a habit of recruiting foot soldiers/cannon fodder from certain local cultures designated as such:</p>

      <p className="quote">Men from martial races were strong, tough, savage. Born into violent, warlike cultures. ... Easily controlled by more graceful, cerebral people—a rare few whipped into shape as honorable soldiers for a good cause, more commonly forged into evil forces’ rank and file. Like orcs.</p>

      <p><strong>Fun replacement!</strong> Have you ever considered using a <strong>hobgoblin legion</strong> as antagonists instead? Their design <a href="https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Hobgoblin">draws from fascism</a>, and lord knows we could use more Nazi-punching these days.</p>

      <p><strong>Extra credit:</strong> Let's ditch race ability modifiers entirely! Both the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/314622/Ancestry--Culture-An-Alternative-to-Race-in-5e">Ancestry and Culture</a> and the <a href="https://gabejamesgames.itch.io/cmm">Class Modifier Module</a> are excellent alternatives. </p>
